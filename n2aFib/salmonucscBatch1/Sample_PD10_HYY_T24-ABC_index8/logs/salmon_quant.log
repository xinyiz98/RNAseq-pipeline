[2020-05-27 20:35:59.754] [jointLog] [info] Computed 39092 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-05-27 20:35:59.754] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3560789 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-05-27 20:35:59.761] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3560789 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
