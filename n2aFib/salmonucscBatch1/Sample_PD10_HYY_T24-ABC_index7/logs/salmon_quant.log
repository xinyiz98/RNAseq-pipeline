Observed 4712202 total fragments (4712202 in most recent round)

[2020-05-27 20:35:34.081] [jointLog] [info] Computed 38717 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-05-27 20:35:34.081] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3920070 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-05-27 20:35:34.090] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3920070 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
