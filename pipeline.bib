We intended to evaluate the plausibility of 3 D-printed (3 DP) scaffold coated with mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) seeded in fibrin for the repair of partial tracheal defects. MSCs from rabbit bone marrow were expanded and cultured. A half-pipe-shaped 3 DP polycaprolactone scaffold was coated with the MSCs seeded in fibrin. The half-pipe tracheal graft was implanted on a 10 × 10-mm artificial tracheal defect in four rabbits. Four and eight weeks after the operation, the reconstructed sites were evaluated bronchoscopically, radiologically, histologically, and functionally. None of the four rabbits showed any sign of respiratory distress. Endoscopic examination and computed tomography showed successful reconstruction of trachea without any collapse or blockage. The replaced tracheas were completely covered with regenerated respiratory mucosa. Histologic analysis showed that the implanted 3 DP tracheal grafts were successfully integrated with the adjacent trachea without disruption or granulation tissue formation. Neo-cartilage formation inside the implanted graft was sufficient to maintain the patency of the reconstructed trachea. Scanning electron microscope examination confirmed the regeneration of the cilia, and beating frequency of regenerated cilia was not different from those of the normal adjacent mucosa. The shape and function of reconstructed trachea using 3 DP scaffold coated with MSCs seeded in fibrin were restored successfully without any graft rejection.},

There is a substantial need for tissue-engineered skin bioconstructs and research is active in this field. Significant progress has been made over the years in the development and clinical use of bioengineered components of the various skin layers. Off-the-shelf availability of such constructs, or production of sufficient quantities of biological materials to aid rapid wound closure, are often the only means to help patients with major skin loss. The aim of this review is to describe those materials already commercially available for clinical use as well as to give a short insight to those under development. It seeks to provide skin scientists/tissue engineers with the information required to not only develop in vitro models of skin, but to move closer to achieving the ultimate goal of an off-the-shelf, complete full-thickness skin replacement.},

Findings indicate that yoga is discursively detached from its religious origins and linked to an abstract and expansive spiritualism. Instructors also hope to initiate spiritual engagement among students through physical practice. These findings are contextualized with regard to cultural appropriation, ownership, and hybridity.},

	abstract = {As social roles and relationships become increasingly inseparable from people's interactions with information technologies (ITs), new constructs representing this intertwinement are needed to expand understandings of human behavior. As part of that endeavor, this paper draws on structural symbolic interactionist identity theories to systematically develop a conceptual definition of one such construct, IT identity—defined as the extent to which an individual views use of an IT as integral to his or her sense of self—as a new form of identity. The construct is framed within a theoretical model. Our goal is to facilitate the establishment of IT identity as an important and relevant construct that can improve our understanding of a variety of phenomena. In doing so, this paper makes three contributions to the information systems (IS) literature. First, it delineates current understanding of IT as a medium, determinant, or consequent of identity. Second, it defines the conceptual domain and theme of IT identity, which is necessary for investigating the construct's theoretical influence. Third, it demonstrates the utility of IT identity to a wide range of IS topics relating to how people express, maintain, and expand their self-concepts. In doing so, it offers potential directions and opportunities for IS researchers to incorporate this novel concept into IS research.},

Drawing from Judge et al.'s (2009, J. Appl. Psychol., 94, 742) model of income antecedents and Caspi et al.'s (1989, J. Pers., 57, 375) concepts of cumulative and interactional continuity, this study investigated the pathways leading from these characteristics to career outcomes. Specifically, we developed a model with links involving (1) attractiveness, intelligence, and self-control; (2) self-evaluations, delinquent behaviours, educational attainment, and job complexity; and (3) income and job satisfaction. The model was examined with data from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Results supported a slightly modified model, with major findings indicating attractiveness, intelligence, and self-control measured during adolescence predicted later self-evaluations or delinquent behaviour; these variables predicted later education level; education level predicted job complexity; and job complexity predicted income and job satisfaction. Implications related to this integrated model are discussed.


Practitioner points





* Interventions might focus on enhancing self-control-related skills in adolescents in an effort to improve later work-related outcomes.


* Core self-evaluations and delinquent tendencies could also be targeted during adolescence to influence life pathways relevant to career outcomes.},

	abstract = {This exploratory study aimed to investigate the impact of the office design on workplace conflicts, with a special attention to noise in the office. A gender perspective was applied. The sample consisted of 5229 employees from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health 2010 (SLOSH), working in different office types. In the multivariate analysis office type was used as the explanatory variable with adjustments for age, supervisory position and labour market sector. Analysis stratified for gender was used. Among women a significant impact of office type per se on workplace conflicts was found, but not among men. For women several office types differed significantly from the cell-office with regard to prevalence of conflicts during the past two years, but for men only the combi-office differed from the cell-office. Noise had an impact on workplace conflicts, but is not the only explanatory factor since the effect of office type remained also after adjustment for noise in multivariate analyses. Other environmental factors inherent in the office type might thus explain the occurrence of conflicts.},

Synthesizing information from both academic journals and the popular press, the book looks at the relationships of size and scale to the way Americans live their lives and how their way of life is fundamentally shaped by the highway system, cheap land, and incentives. This book is timely because although Americans say they crave community, they continue to construct buildings, such as McMansions and big box stores, that make creating community a challenge. Furthermore, in many ways the movement toward teleworking, discussed in the chapter on office environments, also challenges the traditional place-based formation of community. Although focused on the United States, the book also includes reference to other parts of the world, especially regarding the retail environment.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate perceived health, work environment and self-estimated productivity one month before and at three, six and twelve months after relocation from individual offices to an open-plan office environment. METHODS: Employees from three departments within the same company group and who worked with relatively similar tasks and who were planned to be relocated from private offices to open-plan offices were invited to participate. Questionnaires comprising items from The Salutogenic Health Indicator Scale, The Work Experience Measurement Scale, the questionnaire by Brennan et al. about perceived performance and one question from the Work Ability Index were sent to participants one month before relocation (baseline) to open-plan offices and then at three, six and twelve months after relocation. At baseline, 82 questionnaires were sent out. The response rate was 85\%. At the follow-ups 77-79 questionnaires were sent out and the response-rate was 70\%-81\%. RESULTS: At follow-ups, perceived health, job satisfaction and performance had generally deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that employees' perception of health, work environment and performance decreased during a 12 month period following relocation from individual offices to open-plan offices.},

	abstract = {In open-plan offices, employees often have to work despite being distracted by multiple sources of speech close to them. This disturbance is even more severe when the surrounding conversations are intelligible. For this reason the disruptive power of such babble-like noises can be quantified by measuring speech intelligibility. As such, the Speech Transmission Index is usually used to assess the quality of open-plan offices. In this article, the STI is used to evaluate the nuisance potential of sound environments in an open-plan office. 57 subjects were confronted with a serial memory task in four STI conditions (from 0.25 to 0.65). Noise annoyance was assessed objectively by measuring performance, and subjectively using the NASA-TLX questionnaire for measuring cognitive load. A very strong inter-individual variability appeared in performance measurements. Approximately half of the panel was made of high performing subjects, who proved to be insensitive to speech intelligibility. For the other half, performance was reduced when STI increased, as shown in previous studies, with a plateau for STI greater than 0.45. This strong inter-individual variability can explain the discrepancy between results observed in previously published studies. The NASA-TLX questionnaire proved to give useful complementary results. For example, high-performing subjects related a higher workload in the condition of maximum speech intelligibility.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate if enhanced or worsened sound absorption in open-plan offices is reflected in the employees' ratings of disturbances, cognitive stress, and professional efficacy. Employees working on two different floors of an office building were followed as three manipulations were made in room acoustics on each of the two floors by means of less or more absorbing tiles \&amp; wall absorbents. For one of the floors, the manipulations were from better to worse to better acoustical conditions, while for the other the manipulations were worse to better to worse. The acoustical effects of these manipulations were assessed according to the new ISO-standard (ISO-3382-3, 2012) for open-plan rooms acoustics. In addition, the employees responded to questionnaires after each change. Our analyses showed that within each floor enhanced acoustical conditions were associated with lower perceived disturbances and cognitive stress. There were no effects on professional efficiency. The results furthermore suggest that even a small deterioration in acoustical room properties measured according to the new ISO-standard for open-plan office acoustics has a negative impact on self-rated health and disturbances. This study supports previous studies demonstrating the importance of acoustics in work environments and shows that the measures suggested in the new ISO-standard can be used to adequately differentiate between better and worse room acoustics in open plan offices.},

Cet article représente une premiere étape dans l’élucidation du rôle de l’espace dans les interactions transculturelles sur le lieu de travail et montre que l’espace peut devenir pour les managers de groupes de travail culturellement diversifiés un outil de contrôle des conflits potentiellement efficace. The diversity literature is replete with examples of poor outcomes in Culturally Heterogeneous Workgroups (CHWs) caused by relational difficulties.

	abstract = {Using interviews, a laboratory experiment, and a résumé audit study, we examine racial minorities’ attempts to avoid anticipated discrimination in labor markets by concealing or downplaying racial cues in job applications, a practice known as “résumé whitening.” Interviews with racial minority university students reveal that while some minority job seekers reject this practice, others view it as essential and use a variety of whitening techniques. Building on the qualitative findings, we conduct a lab study to examine how racial minority job seekers change their résumés in response to different job postings. Results show that when targeting an employer that presents itself as valuing diversity, minority job applicants engage in relatively little résumé whitening and thus submit more racially transparent résumés. Yet our audit study of how employers respond to whitened and unwhitened résumés shows that organizational diversity statements are not actually associated with reduced discrimination against unwhitened résumés. Taken together, these findings suggest a paradox: minorities may be particularly likely to experience disadvantage when they apply to ostensibly pro-diversity employers. These findings illuminate the role of racial concealment and transparency in modern labor markets and point to an important interplay between the self-presentation of employers and the self-presentation of job seekers in shaping economic inequality.},

They also showed significantly lower satisfaction with noise level and sound privacy and lower job performance perceived by acoustic quality than enclosed private, enclosed shared, and bullpen types. The bullpen type, open-plan office without partitions, presented significantly higher satisfaction with noise level and higher performance perceived by acoustic quality than both high and low cubicles. Considering the bullpen type also showed higher satisfaction with sound privacy than the high cubicle type, high partitions don't seem to contribute to creating workspaces where people can have a secure conversation. The bullpen type didn't show any difference from the enclosed shared type in all privacy, interaction, and acoustic quality questions, indicating it may be a good option for a small office space instead of the enclosed shared type.},

	abstract = {Beneficial effects of noise on higher cognition have recently attracted attention. Hypothesizing an involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine system and its functional interactions with cortical areas, the current study aimed to demonstrate a facilitation of dopamine-dependent attentional and mnemonic functions by externally applying white noise in five behavioral experiments including a total sample of 167 healthy human subjects. During working memory, acoustic white noise impaired accuracy when presented during the maintenance period (experiment 1-3). In a reward based long-term memory task, white noise accelerated perceptual judgments for scene images during encoding but left subsequent recognition memory unaffected (experiment 4). In a modified Posner task (experiment 5), the benefit due to white noise in attentional orienting correlated weakly with reward dependence, a personality trait that has been associated with the dopaminergic system. These results suggest that white noise has no general effect on cognitive functions. Instead, they indicate differential effects on perception and cognition depending on a variety of factors such as task demands and timing of white noise presentation.},

However, aging is also associated with increased between-subject variability, and it is unclear in which features of processing older high-performing and low-performing human beings may differ in goal-directed behavior. To study involuntary shifts in attention to task-irrelevant deviant stimuli and subsequent reorientation, we used an auditory distraction task and analyzed event-related potential measures (mismatch negativity), P3a and reorienting negativity) of 35 younger, 32 older high-performing, and 32 older low-performing participants. Although both high and low performing elderly individuals showed a delayed reorienting to the primary stimulus feature, relative to young participants, poor performance of the elderly participants in processing of deviant stimuli was associated with strong involuntary attention capture by task-irrelevant features. In contrast, high performance of the elderly group was associated with intensified attentional shifting toward the target features. Thus, it appears that performance deficits in aging are due to higher distractibility in combination with deficits in the orienting–reorienting mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses and evaluates the impact of cognitive (or self-perceived) age on grocery-store patronage by elderly shoppers. Cognitive age is seen to be a more accurate reflection of changes related to age and aging than chronological age. Based on self-concept theory, the authors propose that cognitive age moderates the effects of perceptions of store attributes on satisfaction with a store. The hypotheses tests used a sample of 404 supermarket patrons aged 60 and above. The latent construct, cognitive age, was operationalised by six items: feel, look, do, interest, health, and think age. The cognitive ages of our respondents proved to be significantly lower than their chronological ages. To evaluate the moderating effects, we applied the product-indicator approach using variance-based structural equation modelling. The results show that the impacts of product range, manoeuvrability, and atmosphere within the store on satisfaction become significantly stronger with increasing cognitive age. We conclude that cognitive age dimensions influence perceptions and, subsequently, behaviour related to store patronage, and thus contribute to the understanding of the growing segment of elderly shoppers.},

On the other hand, open-plan layouts are widely acknowledged to be more disruptive due to uncontrollable noise and loss of privacy. Based on the occupant survey database from Center for the Built Environment (CBE), empirical analyses indicated that occupants assessed Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) issues in different ways depending on the spatial configuration (classified by the degree of enclosure) of their workspace. Enclosed private offices clearly outperformed open-plan layouts in most aspects of IEQ, particularly in acoustics, privacy and the proxemics issues. Benefits of enhanced ‘ease of interaction’ were smaller than the penalties of increased noise level and decreased privacy resulting from open-plan office configuration.},

As France found itself embroiled in the brutal and bloody Algerian War of Independence, many started reflecting on the meaning and aftereffects of the Second World War. Despite its anti-colonial universalist humanism, Hiroshima remains haunted by colonial ghosts and fantasies of post-war ‘Asia’ where Asian female bodies are passive and Asian male bodies only echo other European male bodies. Ultimately, sexual and racial differences organise the film's narrative of war and canonises a Eurocentric version of ‘history’. The film's melodramatic love story renders invisible the ways gender and sexuality shape understandings of violence, wars, and violated bodies. Against Marguerite Duras's and Alain Resnais's intentions, the love story allows the remembering and forgetting of a (French) national history that only the female character embodies. Only the French woman stands in for subjectivity, memory and trauma, rendering everything else secondary. Once read as a historical text, the film illustrates the limits and ambivalences of post-war anti-colonial humanist political imagination.},

	abstract = {The need for engineering students to develop nuanced understandings of the cultural, social, and political contexts of socio-technical systems has never been more obvious to engineering leaders and decision-makers. Yet, engineers often have obtuse definitions of their responsibilities to the public and seem to engage with the socio-cultural contexts and consequences of their work only in times controversy. A central underlying factor in this disengagement from considerations of social justice and equality is the ideology of depoliticization, the belief that engineering is a purely “technical” space in which engineers design technological objects and systems stripped of political and cultural concerns. In this chapter, we ask, what role does the culture and structure of engineering education play in promoting depoliticization? After elaborating the ideology of depoliticization, we argue that the culture of engineering pedagogy and the traditional curricular structure of engineering education (both its accreditation process and its intra-program curricula) help support and promote an ideology of depoliticization in engineering and train students to adopt this ideology within their own understandings of their professional roles and responsibilities. We end by discussing the consequences of having depoliticization embedded in the culture and structure of engineering education, and suggest possible policy solutions to re-politicize engineering education.},

In the current work, we evaluate nine different trimming algorithms in four datasets and three common NGS-based applications (RNA-Seq, SNP calling and genome assembly). Trimming is shown to increase the quality and reliability of the analysis, with concurrent gains in terms of execution time and computational resources needed.},

Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

Three highly co-expressed clusters were identified based on their correlation coefficient values and fold change ratio. SM2miR drugs of the miRs contained in the three highly co-expressed clusters were identified, and drugs common among these clusters were selected. Co-expressed miRs not previously known to be associated with PD were identified from both the samples. Functional enrichment analyses of these miR targets were done, and the pathways common and unique to both the samples were identified. Thus, our study presents a comparative analysis of miRs, their associated pathways, and drugs from brain and blood samples of PD that may help in system level understanding of this disease. miRs identified from our study may serve as biomarkers for PD.},

We report here that 1541-induced cell death is caused by the fibrillar rather than the soluble form of the drug. A short hairpin RNA screen reveals that knockdown of genes involved in endocytosis, vesicle trafficking and lysosomal acidification causes partial 1541 resistance. We confirm the role of these pathways using pharmacological inhibitors. Microscopy shows that the fluorescent chemi-fibrils accumulate in punctae inside cells that partially colocalize with lysosomes. Notably, the chemi-fibrils bind and induce liposome leakage in vitro, suggesting they may do the same in cells. The chemi-fibrils induce extensive proteolysis including caspase substrates, yet modulatory profiling reveals that chemi-fibrils form a distinct class from existing inducers of cell death. The chemi-fibrils share similarities with proteinaceous fibrils and may provide insight into their mechanism of cellular toxicity.},

We used the double-nicking CRISPR/Cas9 system to conduct site-specific mutagenesis of SNCA in these cells, generating an isogenic iPSC line with normalized SNCA gene dosage. Comparative gene expression analysis of neuronal derivatives from these iPSCs revealed an ER stress phenotype, marked by induction of the IRE1α/XBP1 axis of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and culminating in terminal UPR activation. Neuropathological analysis of post-mortem brain tissue demonstrated that pIRE1α is expressed in PD brains within neurons containing elevated levels of α-synuclein or Lewy bodies.

	abstract = {Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis results in a stress condition termed ‘ER stress’ determining the activation of a finely regulated program defined as Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and whose primary aim is to restore this organelle’s physiological activity. Several physiological and pathological stimuli deregulate normal ER activity causing UPR activation, such as hypoxia, glucose shortage, genome instability and cytotoxic compounds administration. Some of these stimuli are frequently observed during uncontrolled proliferation of transformed cells, resulting in tumour core formation and stage progression. Therefore, it is not surprising that ER stress is usually induced during solid tumour development and stage progression, becoming an hallmark of such malignancies. Several UPR components are in fact deregulated in different tumour types and accumulating data indicate their active involvement in tumour development/progression. However, although the UPR program is primarily a pro-survival process, sustained and/or prolonged stress may result in cell death induction. Therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) regulating the cell survival/death decision under ER stress condition may be crucial in order to specifically target tumour cells and possibly circumvent or overcome tumour resistance to therapies. In this review, we discuss the role played by the UPR program in tumor initiation, progression and resistance to therapy, highlighting the recent advances that have improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the survival/death switch.},

Each of these neurodegenerative conditions, known collectively as α-synucleinopathies, may be characterized by a different suite of molecular triggers that initiate pathogenesis. The mechanisms whereby α-synuclein aggregates mediate cytotoxicity also remain to be fully elucidated. However, recent studies have implicated the cell-to-cell spread of α-synuclein as the major mode of disease propagation between brain regions during disease progression. Here, we review the current evidence for different modes of α-synuclein cellular release, movement and uptake, including exocytosis, exosomes, tunneling nanotubes, glymphatic flow and endocytosis. A more detailed understanding of the major modes by which α-synuclein pathology spreads throughout the brain may provide new targets for therapies that halt the progression of disease.},

Immunoreactivity for the UPR activation markers phosphorylated pancreatic ER kinase (pPERK) and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (peIF2alpha) is detected in neuromelanin containing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of PD cases but not in control cases. In addition, pPERK immunoreactivity is colocalized with increased alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in dopaminergic neurons.

The effects of the A30P mutation on membrane association in yeast are consistent with its poor membrane-binding capacity in other systems (13, 14).
 
Indeed, simply doubling αSyn expression, by integrating a second copy in the genome, profoundly changed its fate: The vast majority of αSyn appeared in large cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 1B). Notably, inclusions were not formed by excess protein unable to find “docking sites” at the membrane: (i) Much less protein was membrane-localized in two-copy strains than in single-copy strains (Fig. 1B); and (ii) in time courses with two-copy strains, αSyn first accumulated at the membrane and was later recruited away into cytoplasmic inclusions. 
 
 
different in concentration dependence of toxicity
 
Notably, membrane-bound αSyn is in dynamic equilibrium with cytoplasmic forms. Just a twofold difference in expression was sufficient to cause a catastrophic change in its behavior, inducing nucleated polymerization and recruiting protein previously associated with membranes to cytoplasmic inclusions. This nucleated polymerization process suggests a mechanism by which even small changes in the QC balance of aging neurons could produce a toxic gain of αSyn function concomitantly with a loss of normal function. Thus, two hypotheses [gain of toxic function or loss of normal function (31)] put forward to explain PD can be reconciled by a single molecular mechanism.},

	abstract = {Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONParkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and leads to slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity, and, in the later stages of PD, cognitive impairment. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and neurites. There is degeneration of neurons throughout the nervous system, with the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to the major symptoms of PD.
RATIONALEIn the brains of PD patients, pathologic α-synuclein seems to spread from cell to cell via self-amplification, propagation, and transmission in a stereotypical and topographical pattern among neighboring cells and/or anatomically connected brain regions. The spread or transmission of pathologic α-synuclein is emerging as a potentially important driver of PD pathogenesis. The underlying mechanisms and molecular entities responsible for the transmission of pathologic α-synuclein from cell to cell are not known, but the entry of pathologic α-synuclein into neurons is thought to occur, in part, through an active clathrin-dependent endocytic process.
RESULTSUsing recombinant α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) as a model system with which to study the transmission of misfolded α-synuclein from neuron to neuron, we screened a library encoding transmembrane proteins for α-synuclein-biotin PFF–binding candidates via detection with streptavidin-AP (alkaline phosphatase) staining. Three positive clones were identified that bind α-synuclein PFF and include lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), neurexin 1β, and amyloid β precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1). Of these three transmembrane proteins, LAG3 demonstrated the highest ratio of selectivity for α-synuclein PFF over the α-synuclein monomer. α-Synuclein PFF bind to LAG3 in a saturable manner (dissociation constant = 77 nM), whereas the α-synuclein monomer does not bind to LAG3. Co-immunoprecipitation also suggests that pathological α-synuclein PFF specifically bind to LAG3. Tau PFF, β-amyloid oligomer, and β-amyloid PFF do not bind to LAG3, indicating that LAG3 is specific for α-synuclein PFF. The internalization of α-synuclein PFF involves LAG3 because deletion of LAG3 reduces the endocytosis of α-synuclein PFF. LAG3 colocalizes with the endosomal guanosine triphosphatases Rab5 and Rab7 and coendocytoses with pathologic α-synuclein. Neuron-to-neuron transmission of pathologic α-synuclein and the accompanying pathology and neurotoxicity is substantially attenuated by deletion of LAG3 or by antibodies to LAG3. The lack of LAG3 also substantially delayed α-synuclein PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo.
CONCLUSIONWe discovered that pathologic α-synuclein transmission and toxicity is initiated by binding to LAG3 and that neuron-to-neuron transmission of pathological α-synuclein involves the endocytosis of exogenous α-synuclein PFF by the engagement of LAG3 on neurons. Depletion of LAG3 or antibodies to LAG3 substantially reduces the pathology set in motion by the transmission of pathologic α-synuclein. The identification of LAG3 as an α-synuclein PFF–binding protein provides a new target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6307/aah3374/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint LAG3 deletion or antibodies to LAG3 delay α-synuclein PFF transmission.Compared with wild-type neurons, binding and endocytosis of α-synuclein PFF is dramatically reduced with antibodies to LAG3 or when LAG3 is deleted, resulting in delayed pathologic α-synuclein transmission and toxicity.

Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.},

	abstract = {Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.
In vertebrates, it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Plasma, which constitutes 55\% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92\% by volume), and contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes) and platelets (also called thrombocytes). The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma.
Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. In most insects, this "blood" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen.
Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood. Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system.
Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled.
Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato- (also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word αἷμα (haima) for "blood". In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.},

In the ascending aorta the highest velocities and stroke volumes were achieved during late expiration while in the pulmonary artery blood velocity and stroke volume were greatest in inspiration. In nine patients the cardiac outputs calculated from the product of mean velocity and radiologically measured cross-sectional area of the ascending aorta or pulmonary artery were compared with cardiac outputs determined by the indicator-dilution method; the correlation coefficient was 0.73.

We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods.

	abstract = {C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) are two of the most commonly used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research. However, the only currently available mouse genome is based entirely on the B6 strain sequence. Subsequently, oligonucleotide microarray probes are based solely on this B6 reference sequence, making their application for gene expression profiling comparisons across mouse strains dubious due to their allelic sequence differences, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the RNA-Seq application provides a clear alternative to oligonucleotide arrays for detecting differential gene expression without the problems inherent to hybridization-based technologies. Using RNA-Seq, an average of 22 million short sequencing reads were generated per sample for 21 samples (10 B6 and 11 D2), and these reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome, allowing 16,183 Ensembl genes to be queried in striatum for both strains. To determine differential expression, 'digital mRNA counting' is applied based on reads that map to exons. The current study compares RNA-Seq (Illumina GA IIx) with two microarray platforms (Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 and Affymetrix MOE 430 2.0) to detect differential striatal gene expression between the B6 and D2 inbred mouse strains. We show that by using stringent data processing requirements differential expression as determined by RNA-Seq is concordant with both the Affymetrix and Illumina platforms in more instances than it is concordant with only a single platform, and that instances of discordance with respect to direction of fold change were rare. Finally, we show that additional information is gained from RNA-Seq compared to hybridization-based techniques as RNA-Seq detects more genes than either microarray platform. The majority of genes differentially expressed in RNA-Seq were only detected as present in RNA-Seq, which is important for studies with smaller effect sizes where the sensitivity of hybridization-based techniques could bias interpretation.},

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data., Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org)., Contact: mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the correlation between the returns of different securities is of fundamental importance in many areas of finance, such as portfolio optimisation. The most commonly used measure of correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient; however, this suffers from several problems when applied to data from the real world. We propose an alternative estimator - the Biweight Mid Correlation (Bicor) - as a more robust measure for capturing the relationship between returns. We systematically evaluate Bicor empirically using data from the FTSE 100 constituents, and show that it is more robust when compared with the Pearson correlation coefficient. Finally, we demonstrate that Bicor can be used to improve a graph-based method of portfolio construction. Specifically, we show that when treating the correlation matrix as an adjacency matrix for a graph and using graph centrality to construct portfolios, the use of Bicor leads to better performing portfolios.},

	abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%–40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is also included for use in the available software.},

The problem is especially challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads, or ‘sequencing depths’. Existing methods for this problem are based on Poisson or negative binomial models: they are useful but can be heavily influenced by ‘outliers’ in the data. We introduce a simple, nonparametric method with resampling to account for the different sequencing depths. The new method is more robust than parametric methods. It can be applied to data with quantitative, survival, two-class or multiple-class outcomes. We compare our proposed method to Poisson and negative binomial-based methods in simulated and real data sets, and find that our method discovers more consistent patterns than competing methods.},

Our study results here demonstrate that hyperosmotic stress induced H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) by an unrevealed kinase cascade involving polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. We found that hyperosmotic stress induced DNA-double strand breaks and increased γH2AX in HCE cells. Phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 was catalyzed by hyperosmotic stress-induced activation of Plk3. Plk3 directly interacted with H2AX and was colocalized with γH2AX in the nuclei of hyperosmotic stress-induced cells. Suppression of Plk3 activity by overexpression of a kinase-silencing mutant or by knocking down Plk3 mRNA effectively reduced γH2AX in hyperosmotic stress-induced cells. This was consistent with results that show γH2AX was markedly suppressed in the Plk3(-/-) knock-out mouse corneal epithelial layer in response to hyperosmotic stimulation. The effect of hyperosmotic stress-activated Plk3 and increased γH2AX in cell cycle progression showed an accumulation of G2/M phase, altered population in G1 and S phases, and increased apoptosis. Our results for the first time reveal that hyperosmotic stress-activated Plk3 elicited γH2AX. This Plk3-mediated activation of γH2AX subsequently regulates the cell cycle progression and cell fate.},

DDIT3 is known as a key regulator of cellular stress response, but its target genes and functions are not well characterized. Here, we applied a genome wide microarray based expression analysis to identify DDIT3 target genes and functions. By analyzing cells carrying tamoxifen inducible DDIT3 expression constructs we show distinct gene expression profiles for cells with cytoplasmic and nuclear localized DDIT3. Of 175 target genes identified only 3 were regulated by DDIT3 in both cellular localizations. More than two thirds of the genes were downregulated, supporting a role for DDIT3 as a dominant negative factor that could act by either cytoplasmic or nuclear sequestration of dimer forming transcription factor partners. Functional annotation of target genes showed cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis/survival as the most affected categories. Cytoplasmic DDIT3 affected more migration associated genes, while nuclear DDIT3 regulated more cell cycle controlling genes. Cell culture experiments confirmed that cytoplasmic DDIT3 inhibited migration, while nuclear DDIT3 caused a G1 cell cycle arrest. Promoters of target genes showed no common sequence motifs, reflecting that DDIT3 forms heterodimers with several alternative transcription factors that bind to different motifs. We conclude that expression of cytoplasmic DDIT3 regulated 94 genes. Nuclear translocation of DDIT3 regulated 81 additional genes linked to functions already affected by cytoplasmic DDIT3. Characterization of DDIT3 regulated functions helps understanding its role in stress response and involvement in cancer and degenerative disorders.},

Here we report a major alternative mechanism for caspase activation in vivo involving the F-box protein DRE-1. DRE-1 functions in parallel to EGL-1, requires CED-9 for activity, and binds to CED-9, suggesting that DRE-1 promotes apoptosis by inactivating CED-9. FBXO10, a human protein related to DRE-1, binds BCL2 and promotes its degradation, thereby initiating cell death. Moreover, some human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have inactivating mutations in FBXO10 or express FBXO10 at low levels. Our results suggest that DRE-1/FBXO10 is a conserved regulator of apoptosis.},

MATERIALS/METHODS: We investigated the effect of TRIB3 on ER stress-induced β-cell apoptosis in INS-1 cells and primary rodent islets. The potential role of TRIB3 in ER stress inducer thapsigargin (Tg)-induced β-cell apoptosis was assessed using overexpression and siRNA knockdown approaches. Inducible TRIB3 β-cells, regulated by the tet-on system, were used for sub-renal capsule transplantation in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice, to study the effect of TRIB3 on ER stress-induced β-cell apoptosis in vivo. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining both in vivo and in vitro, while the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB activation were investigated.
RESULTS: TRIB3 was induced in ER-stressed INS-1 cells and rodent islets, and its overexpression was accompanied by increased β-cell apoptosis. Specifically, TRIB3 overexpression enhanced Tg-induced INS-1 derived β-cell apoptosis both in vitro and in sub-renal capsular transplantation animal model. Additionally, knockdown of Trib3 blocked Tg-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, the induction of TRIB3 during ER stress resulted in the activation of NF-κB and aggravated INS-1 derived β-cell apoptosis, while inhibiting the NF-κB pathway significantly abrogated this response and prevented β-cell apoptosis, both in vitro and in sub-renal capsular transplantation animal model.
CONCLUSION: TRIB3 mediated ER stress-induced β-cell apoptosis via the NF-κB pathway.},

We present high-throughput screening (HTS) data for 3 762 distinct global gene knockout (KO) mouse lines with viable adult homozygous mice generated using either gene-trap or homologous recombination technologies. Bone mass was determined from DEXA scans of male and female mice at 14 weeks of age and by microCT analyses of bones from male mice at 16 weeks of age. Wild-type (WT) cagemates/littermates were examined for each gene KO. Lethality was observed in an additional 850 KO lines. Since primary HTS are susceptible to false positive findings, additional cohorts of mice from KO lines with intriguing HTS bone data were examined. Aging, ovariectomy, histomorphometry and bone strength studies were performed and possible non-skeletal phenotypes were explored. Together, these screens identified multiple genes affecting bone mass: 23 previously reported genes (Calcr, Cebpb, Crtap, Dcstamp, Dkk1, Duoxa2, Enpp1, Fgf23, Kiss1/Kiss1r, Kl (Klotho), Lrp5, Mstn, Neo1, Npr2, Ostm1, Postn, Sfrp4, Slc30a5, Slc39a13, Sost, Sumf1, Src, Wnt10b), five novel genes extensively characterized (Cldn18, Fam20c, Lrrk1, Sgpl1, Wnt16), five novel genes with preliminary characterization (Agpat2, Rassf5, Slc10a7, Slc26a7, Slc30a10) and three novel undisclosed genes coding for potential osteoporosis drug targets.},

	abstract = {Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis results in a stress condition termed “ER stress” determining the activation of a finely regulated program defined as unfolded protein response (UPR) and whose primary aim is to restore this organelle’s physiological activity. Several physiological and pathological stimuli deregulate normal ER activity causing UPR activation, such as hypoxia, glucose shortage, genome instability, and cytotoxic compounds administration. Some of these stimuli are frequently observed during uncontrolled proliferation of transformed cells, resulting in tumor core formation and stage progression. Therefore, it is not surprising that ER stress is usually induced during solid tumor development and stage progression, becoming an hallmark of such malignancies. Several UPR components are in fact deregulated in different tumor types, and accumulating data indicate their active involvement in tumor development/progression. However, although the UPR program is primarily a pro-survival process, sustained and/or prolonged stress may result in cell death induction. Therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) regulating the cell survival/death decision under ER stress condition may be crucial in order to specifically target tumor cells and possibly circumvent or overcome tumor resistance to therapies. In this review, we discuss the role played by the UPR program in tumor initiation, progression and resistance to therapy, highlighting the recent advances that have improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the survival/death switch.},

We previously identified TRIM35 as a novel tumor suppressor in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism that TRIM35 uses to suppress tumorigenicity is largely unknown. Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) has been demonstrated to have a central role in metabolic reprogramming during cancer progression. Phosphorylation of PKM2 tyrosine residue 105 (Y105) regulates PKM2 to provide a metabolic advantage to tumor cells, thereby promoting tumor growth. In the present work, mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated an interaction between TRIM35 and PKM2. Co-IP experiments confirmed that TRIM35 interacts with PKM2 and that the coiled-coil domain is required for such an interaction. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain mediates decreases in the Warburg effect and in the cell proliferation of HCC cells. In addition, TRIM35 suppresses the tumorigenicity of HCC cells through the blockade of PKM2 Y105 phosphorylation. Collectively, our data reveal a new function for TRIM35, which is to regulate the Warburg effect and tumorigenicity through interaction with PKM2 in HCC.},

Both ERK and JNK stress kinase pathways were activated in Fas-treated 661W cells, but only the inhibition of the ERK pathway reduced the levels of Faim2. Blocking the ERK pathway using a pharmacological inhibitor increased the susceptibility of 661W cells to Fas-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. When the levels of Faim2 were reduced in 661W cells by siRNA knockdown, Fas activating antibody treatment resulted in earlier and more robust caspase activation, and increased cell death. These results demonstrate that Faim2 acts as a neuroprotectant during Fas-mediated apoptosis of 661W cells. The expression of Faim2 is triggered, at least in part, by Fas-receptor activation and subsequent ERK signaling. Our findings identify a novel protective pathway that auto-regulates Fas-induced photoreceptor apoptosis in vitro. Modulation of this pathway to increase Faim2 expression may be a potential therapeutic option to prevent photoreceptor death.},

Yeast Mms2 is a Ubc variant and plays an important role in error-free DNA postreplication repair to protect cells from killing by DNA damaging agents and mutagenesis. Ironically, one of two known Mms2 homologs, CROC1, has been linked to cell immortalization and tumorigenesis. To further investigate cellular roles played by mammalian Mms2 homologs, we report here the molecular cloning, tissue distribution and functional characterization of two mouse cDNAs encoding mMMS2 and mCROC1. Unlike human CROC1, the mCROC1 gene does not encode two alternative transcripts in most tissues. Instead, nonoverlapping sequences were found in two distinct cDNA clones that together would constitute a full-length open reading frame homologous to CROC1B. Both mMMS2 and the C-terminal mCROC1 core domain are able to complement the yeast mms2 mutant functionally and are able to interact with Ubc13 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, indicating that they are true yeast Mms2 homologs and may play a similar role in DNA postreplication repair. We propose several hypotheses to reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations regarding roles of the two mammalian Mms2 homologs in tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis.},

Real-time PCR and western blotting indicated that Mcl-1 transcript and protein expression are upregulated during infection with virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Xinjiang strains but not with attenuated M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin. Mcl-1 transcript and protein expression were downregulated by specific inhibitors of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (AG490, PD98059 and LY294002, respectively). The strongest inhibitor of Mcl-1 expression was PD98059, the MAPK inhibitor. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the rate of apoptosis in peritoneal macrophages is significantly higher in mice infected with M. tuberculosis and the rate of apoptosis is correlated with the virulence of the strain of M. tuberculosis. Apoptosis was found to be upregulated by AG490, PD98059 and LY294002, whereas inhibition of the MAPK pathway sensitized the infected macrophages to apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that specific downregulation of Mcl-1 significantly increases apoptosis of peritoneal macrophages and that the MAPK signaling pathway is the primary mediator of Mcl-1 expression.},

(2) Perceptions of individuals and groups tend to be at least moderately, and often highly accurate. (3) Conclusions based on the research on error, bias, and self-fulfilling prophecies routinely greatly overstate their power and pervasiveness, and consistently ignore evidence of accuracy, agreement, and rationality in social perception. The weight of the evidence – including some of the most classic research widely interpreted as testifying to the power of biased and self-fulfilling processes – is that interpersonal expectations relate to social reality primarily because they reflect rather than cause social reality. This is the case not only for teacher expectations, but also for social stereotypes, both as perceptions of groups, and as the bases of expectations regarding individuals. The time is long overdue to replace cherry-picked and unjustified stories emphasizing error, bias, the power of self-fulfilling prophecies, and the inaccuracy of stereotypes, with conclusions that more closely correspond to the full range of empirical findings, which includes multiple failed replications of classic expectancy studies, meta-analyses consistently demonstrating small or at best moderate expectancy effects, and high accuracy in social perception.},

Student achievement may confirm teacher expectations because these expectations create self-fulfilling prophecies, create perceptual biases, or accurately predict, without influencing, student achievement (Jussim, 1989). Another purpose was to examine the mediating role played by students' perceived ability in the teacher expectancy process. Study data were obtained from 173 students and 7 teachers. Path analysis revealed that teacher expectations have weak self-fulfilling effects, strongly predicted student achievement mainly because they are accurate, and have no biasing effects on teacher judgements. Results also show evidence concerning the role of partial mediator of perceived student ability in the confirmation process of teacher expectations. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) was one of the most commonly diagnosed malignant cancers in males in China. Cell-cycle aberration was a hallmark of cancer. SPC25, a component of Ndc80 complex, played an important role in regulating mitotic chromosome segregation. However, the functional roles of SPC25 in prostate cancer were still poorly understood. Our study showed for the first time that SPC25 was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer. To explore the molecular function roles of SPC25, we performed loss of function assay and found SPC25 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and induced the decrease in S phase and the increase in G2/M phase. Furthermore, SPC25 knockdown promoted apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Of note, bioinformatics analysis also revealed multiple functional roles of SPC25 in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, role of tissue factor in cancer, TGF-β signaling, and sumoylation pathway in PCa. Here, we also evaluated possible prognostic value of SPC25 using TCGA RNA-seq data and we found showed SPC25 was upregulated in high pathology stage PCa. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that Lower SPC25 expression level was associated with better survival of PCa patients. All these results suggest that SPC25 play an oncogenic role in PCa and could act as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Summary
Equal chromosome segregation requires proper assembly of many proteins, including Bub3, onto kinetochores to promote kinetochore-microtubule interactions. By screening for mitotic regulators in the spindle envelope and matrix (Spemix), we identify a conserved Bub3 interacting and GLE-2-binding sequence (GLEBS) containing ZNF207 (BuGZ) that associates with spindle microtubules and regulates chromosome alignment. Using its conserved GLEBS, BuGZ directly binds and stabilizes Bub3. BuGZ also uses its microtubule-binding domain to enhance the loading of Bub3 to kinetochores that have assumed initial interactions with microtubules in prometaphase. This enhanced Bub3 loading is required for proper chromosome alignment and metaphase to anaphase progression. Interestingly, we show that microtubules are required for the highest kinetochore loading of Bub3, BubR1, and CENP-E during prometaphase. These findings suggest that BuGZ not only serves as a molecular chaperone for Bub3 but also enhances its loading onto kinetochores during prometaphase in a microtubule-dependent manner to promote chromosome alignment.},

Most adult mammalian tissues are quiescent, with rare cell divisions serving to maintain homeostasis. At present, the isolation and study of replicating cells from their in vivo niche typically involves immunostaining for intracellular markers of proliferation, causing the loss of sensitive biological material. We describe a transgenic mouse strain, expressing a CyclinB1-GFP fusion reporter, that marks replicating cells in the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Using flow cytometry, we isolate live replicating cells from the liver and compare their transcriptome to that of quiescent cells to reveal gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation in vivo. We find that replicating hepatocytes have reduced expression of genes characteristic of liver differentiation. This reporter system provides a powerful platform for gene expression and metabolic and functional studies of replicating cells in their in vivo niche.

In M phase, the epitopes are produced by cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase by a highly conserved mechanism believed to be quiescent in terminally differentiated neurons of adult brain. To determine whether an M-phase mechanism is possible in AD neurons, we first investigated the presence of cdc2 and cyclin B1 in AD. Both proteins were enriched in neurons with NFT and in neurons susceptible to NFT. An antibody specific for catalytically active cdc2 stained numerous NFT-containing neurons in AD but did not react with normal neurons. Double-labeling studies showed that active cdc2 and cyclin B1 coexist in AD neurons and co-localize with AD-specific mitotic phospho-epitopes. Mitotic kinase purified from AD and normal brain, using the yeast p13suc1 protein as affinity ligand, showed higher histone H1 phosphorylation activity in AD. Accordingly, the levels of cdc2 and cyclin B1 in p13suc1 fractions from AD were higher than normal. Consistent with a physiological relationship between NFT and mitotic kinase, NFT proteins co-purified with and became phosphorylated by the p13suc1-bound kinase in vitro. Furthermore, cdc2/cyclin B1 is the only one of several proline-directed kinases that created the TG/MC mitotic phospho-epitopes in recombinant tau in vitro. These findings suggest that aberrantly reexpressed cdc2/cyclin B1 in NFT-bearing neurons in AD brain contributes to the generation of M-phase phospho-epitopes in NFT.},

Its physiological function and role in neuronal death remain poorly understood. Recent immunohistochemical studies suggest that cell cycle-related phenomena may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and perhaps other neurodegenerative disorders. In this investigation, we examined the effects of α-synuclein expression levels on cell cycle indices in PC12 cells engineered to conditionally induce α-synuclein expression upon withdrawal of doxycycline. Over-expression of α-synuclein resulted in enhanced proliferation rate and enrichment of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. This was associated with increased accumulation of the mitotic factor cyclin B and down-regulation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma 2. Additionally, ERK1/2, key molecules in proliferation signaling, were highly phosphorylated. Immunohistochemical studies on postmortem brains revealed intense cyclin B immunoreactivity in Lewy bodies in cases with DLB and to a lesser extent in PD. We propose that elevated expression of α-synuclein causes changes in cell cycle regulators through ERK activation leading to apoptosis of postmitotic neurons.

	abstract = {The balance between self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) dictates neurogenesis and proper brain development. We found that the RNA- binding protein Sam68 (Khdrbs1) is strongly expressed in neurogenic areas of the neocortex and supports the self-renewing potential of mouse NPCs. Knockout of Khdrbs1 constricted the pool of proliferating NPCs by accelerating their cell cycle exit and differentiation into post-mitotic neurons. Sam68 function was linked to regulation of Aldh1a3 pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. Binding of Sam68 to an intronic polyadenylation site prevents its recognition and premature transcript termination, favoring expression of a functional enzyme. The lower ALDH1A3 expression and activity in Khdrbs1-/- NPCs results in reduced glycolysis and clonogenicity, thus depleting the embryonic NPC pool and limiting cortical expansion. Our study identifies Sam68 as a key regulator of NPC self-renewal and establishes a novel link between modulation of ALDH1A3 expression and maintenance of high glycolytic metabolism in the developing cortex., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20750.001, Neurons develop from cells called neural progenitors. These cells can either divide to produce more progenitor cells or develop into specific types of neurons. These two activities – known as self-renewal and differentiation – must be balanced to produce the right number of specialized neurons, without depleting the pool of progenitor cells. The self-renewal and differentiation of progenitor cells is balanced by essentially regulating which genes are active, or expressed, within the cells., In the first step of gene expression, the genetic instructions are copied to form a molecule of pre-messenger RNA (or pre-mRNA for short). Each pre-mRNA molecule is then processed to produce a final product that can be translated into protein. Importantly, two copies of the same pre-mRNA may sometimes be processed in different ways, which allows multiple proteins to be produced from a single gene., RNA-binding proteins control pre-mRNA processing. The expression of one such protein, called Sam68, oscillates during the development of the nervous system, such that its expression peaks when there is intense production of new neurons and then declines. However, it was not known whether Sam68 actually helps neurons to develop., La Rosa et al. have now analysed the role of Sam68 in the developing brain of mice. The experiments confirmed that Sam68 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and showed that its levels dictate the cell’s fate: high expression encourages a cell to self-renew, while low expression triggers it to develop into a specialized neuron., Further investigation revealed that Sam68 works by promoting the expression of a metabolic enzyme called Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1A3 or ALDH1A3. This enzyme promotes the release of energy from molecules of glucose via a process known as anaerobic glycolysis. La Rosa et al. found that cells that lack Sam68 make a truncated version of the pre-mRNA encoding ALDH1A3. This truncated pre-mRNA encodes a shortened version of the enzyme that is inactive. Further experiments confirmed that Sam68 normally prevents this from happening by binding to the pre-mRNA and processing it to produce the full-length, working version of the ALDH1A3 enzyme. Also, La Rosa et al. found that progenitor cells need working ALDH1A3 to keep them dividing, and to stop them from developing into specialized neurons too soon., Finally, because the processing of pre-RNA plays a major role in brain development, problems with this process often lead to intellectual disabilities and neurodegenerative diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The next step following on from these new findings will be to investigate whether defects in Sam68 contribute to such conditions and, if so, to look for ways to counteract these defects., DOI:

	abstract = {Background
The RNA-binding protein Sam68 has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including transcription, RNA splicing and export, translation, signal transduction, cell cycle progression and replication of the human immunodeficiency virus and poliovirus. However, the precise impact it has on essential cellular functions remains largely obscure.

Results
In this report we show that conditional overexpression of Sam68 in fibroblasts results in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle is associated with decreased levels of cyclins D1 and E RNA and protein, resulting in dramatically reduced Rb phosphorylation. Interestingly, cell cycle arrest does not require the specific RNA binding ability of Sam68. In marked contrast, induction of apoptosis by Sam68 absolutely requires a fully-functional RNA binding domain. Moreover, the anti-cancer agent trichostatin A potentiates Sam68-driven apoptosis.

Conclusions
For the first time we have shown that Sam68, an RNA binding protein with multiple apparent functions, exerts functionally separable effects on cell proliferation and survival, dependent on its ability to bind specifically to RNA. These findings shed new light on the ability of signal transducing RNA binding proteins to influence essential cell function. Moreover, the ability of a class of anti-cancer therapeutics to modulate its ability to promote apoptosis suggests that Sam68 status may impact some cancer treatments.},

Both the CCT protein and mRNA levels in the human promyelolytic cell HL60 decreased concomitant with growth arrest during differentiation. More rapid decrease in CCT level occurred when the mouse interleukin (IL)-3-dependent myeloid DA3 cells were starved for IL-3. Readdition of IL-3 caused rapid resumption of CCT synthesis during synchronous growth: the maximum CCT protein and mRNA levels were observed at G1/S transition through early S phase. The turnover rate of CCT was nearly constant regardless of growth. Gel filtration and immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that CCT in vivo is associated with tubulin at early S phase, but not at G0/G1 phase. These results demonstrated that CCT expression is strongly up-regulated during cell growth especially from G1/S transition to early S phase and is primarily controlled at the mRNA level.

In this study, we found that NUF2 expression was stronger in tumour tissues than in normal pancreatic tissues, and its overexpression could be related to poor prognosis. Moreover, NUF2 was highly expressed in several human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We took advantage of lentivirus-mediated siRNA (small interfering RNA) to suppress NUF2 expression in PANC-1 and Sw1990 cell lines aiming to investigate the role of NUF2 in pancreatic cancer. NUF2 silencing by RANi (RNA interference) reduced the proliferation and colony formation ability of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Cell cycle analysis showed that NUF2 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via suppression of Cyclin B1, Cdc2 and Cdc25A. More importantly, NUF2 silencing was able to alleviate in vivo tumourigenesis in pancreatic cancer xenograft nude mice.

	abstract = {NUF2 (NUF2, Ndc80 kinetochore complex component) plays an important role in kinetochore-microtubule attachment. It has been reported that NUF2 is associated with multiple human cancers. However, the functional role of NUF2 in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this study, we found that NUF2 expression was stronger in tumour tissues than in normal pancreatic tissues, and its overexpression could be related to poor prognosis. Moreover, NUF2 was highly expressed in several human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We took advantage of lentivirus-mediated siRNA (small interfering RNA) to suppress NUF2 expression in PANC-1 and Sw1990 cell lines aiming to investigate the role of NUF2 in pancreatic cancer. NUF2 silencing by RANi (RNA interference) reduced the proliferation and colony formation ability of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Cell cycle analysis showed that NUF2 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via suppression of Cyclin B1, Cdc2 and Cdc25A. More importantly, NUF2 silencing was able to alleviate in vivo tumourigenesis in pancreatic cancer xenograft nude mice. Collectively, the present study indicates that the siRNA-mediated knockdown against NUF2 may be a promising therapeutic method for the treatment of pancreatic cancer., NUF2 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. siRNA-mediated knockdown against NUF2 resulted in a significant reduction in pancreatic cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.

Expression of many micro RNAs is known to alter in cell, animal models and brains of HD patients, but their cellular effects are not known. Here, we show that expression of microRNA-124 (miR-124) is down regulated in HD striatal mutant STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells, a cell model of HD compared to STHdh(Q7)/Hdh(Q7) cells. STHdh(Q7)/Hdh(Q7) and STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells express endogenously full length wild type and mutant HTT respectively. We confirmed this result in R6/2 mouse, an animal model of HD, expressing mutant HTT. Gene Ontology terms related to cell cycle were enriched significantly with experimentally validated targets of miR-124. We observed that expression of Cyclin A2 (CCNA2), a putative target of miR-124 was increased in mutant STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells and brains of R6/2 mice. Fraction of cells in S phase was higher in asynchronously growing mutant STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells compared to wild type STHdh(Q7)/Hdh(Q7) cells and could be altered by exogenous expression or inhibition of miR-124. Exogenous expression or knock down of CCNA2, a target of miR-124, also alters proportion of cells in S phase of HD cell model. In summary, decreased miR-124 expression could increase CCNA2 in cell and animal model of HD and is involved in deregulation of cell cycle in STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells.},

We found that MCM6 and PCNA are expressed in essentially all retinal progenitor cells throughout the proliferative period and these proteins are readily detectable in all cell cycle phases. Furthermore, their expression levels are downregulated as cells exit the cell cycle and differentiate. We also analyzed the expression of Cyclins D1, A2, and B1, and phosphorylated Histone H3 and found unexpected expression patterns and cell cycle profiles.

In mammalian cells, cyclin A accumulates from late G1 phase and is destroyed before metaphase, and cyclin B is destroyed slightly later at anaphase. The abundance of the mitotic cyclins is mainly regulated at the levels of transcription and proteolysis. Transcription is stimulated and repressed by several transcription factors, including B-MYB, E2F, FOXM1, and NF-Y. Elements in the promoter, including CCRE/CDE and CHR, are in part responsible for the cell cycle oscillation of transcription. Destruction of the mitotic cyclins is carried out by the ubiquitin ligases APC/C(CDC20) and APC/C(CDH1). Central to our knowledge is the understanding of how APC/C is turned on from anaphase to early G1 phase, and turned off from late G1 till the spindle-assembly checkpoint is deactivated in metaphase. Reciprocal actions of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) on APC/C, as well as on the SCF complexes ensure that the mitotic cyclins are destroyed only at the proper time.},

	abstract = {Akt, also known as protein kinase B, plays key roles in cell proliferation, survival and metabolism. Akt hyperactivation contributes to many pathophysiological conditions, including human cancers1,2,3, and is closely associated with poor prognosis and chemo- or radiotherapeutic resistance4. Phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (ref. 5) and T308 (ref. 6) activates Akt. However, it remains unclear whether further mechanisms account for full Akt activation, and whether Akt hyperactivation is linked to misregulated cell cycle progression, another cancer hallmark7. Here we report that Akt activity fluctuates across the cell cycle, mirroring cyclin A expression. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of S477 and T479 at the Akt extreme carboxy terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A or mTORC2, under distinct physiological conditions, promotes Akt activation through facilitating, or functionally compensating for, S473 phosphorylation. Furthermore, deletion of the cyclin A2 allele in the mouse olfactory bulb leads to reduced S477/T479 phosphorylation and elevated cellular apoptosis. Notably, cyclin A2-deletion-induced cellular apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells is partly rescued by S477D/T479E-Akt1, supporting a physiological role for cyclin A2 in governing Akt activation. Together, the results of our study show Akt S477/T479 phosphorylation to be an essential layer of the Akt activation mechanism to regulate its physiological functions, thereby providing a new mechanistic link between aberrant cell cycle progression and Akt hyperactivation in cancer.},

	abstract = {MEK1, a gene product that regulates cell growth and differentiation, also plays an important role in Golgi breakdown during the cell cycle. We have recently shown that polo-like kinase (Plk3) is Golgi localized and involved in Golgi dynamics during the cell cycle. To study the mode of action of Plk3 in the Golgi fragmentation cascade, we examined functional as well as physical interactions between Plk3 and MEK1/ERKs. In HeLa cells, although a significant amount of Plk3 signals dispersed in a manner similar to those of Golgi during mitosis concentrated Plk3 was detected at spindle poles, which colocalized with phospho-MEKs and phospho-ERKs. Pull-down assays showed that Plk3 physically interacted with MEK1 and ERK2. Nocodazole activated Plk3 and its activation was blocked by MEK-specific inhibitors (PD98059 or U0126). Moreover, transfection of activated MEK1 resulted in an enhanced kinase activity of Plk3; Plk3-induced fragmentation of Golgi stacks was significantly reduced after treatment with MEK inhibitors. Consistently, ectopic expression of activated MEK1, but not kinase-dead MEK1K97R, stimulated Plk3 to induce Golgi breakdown and the stimulation was not observed in cells expressing Plk3K52R. Furthermore, PLK3−/− murine embryonic fibroblast cells exhibited a significantly less fragmentation of the Golgi complex than that in wild-type cells after exposed to nocodazole. Thus, our studies strongly suggest that Plk3 may be a key protein kinase mediating MEK1 function in the Golgi fragmentation pathway during cell division.},

We investigated the expression pattern of Plk genes and their potential role(s) in the rat ovary during the periovulatory period. Plk2 and Plk3 were highly induced both in intact ovaries and granulosa cells in vivo after treatment with the luteinizing hormone (LH) agonist, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In vitro, hCG stimulated the expression of Plk2 in granulosa cells, but not Plk3. This induction of Plk2 expression was mimicked by both forskolin and phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Moreover, Plk2 expression was reduced by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis or the EGF pathway, but not by progesterone receptor antagonist (RU486) treatment. At the promoter level, mutation of the Sp1 binding sequence abolished the transcriptional activity of the Plk2 gene. ChIP assays also revealed the interaction of endogenous Sp1 protein in the Plk2 promoter region. Functionally, the over-expression of Plk2 and Plk3 arrested granulosa cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, the knockdown of Plk2 expression in granulosa cells decreased the number of cells in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle, but increased granulosa cell viability. In summary, hCG induced Plk2 and Plk3 expression in the rat ovary. Prostaglandins and the EGF signaling pathway are involved in regulating Plk2 expression. The transcription factor Sp1 is important for Plk2 transcriptional up-regulation. Our findings suggest that the increase in Plk2 and Plk3 expression contributes to the cell cycle arrest of granulosa cells which is important for the luteinization of granulosa cells during the periovulatory period.},

In mammals, there are two other members of the polo-like kinase family that are less well understood, Plk2 and Plk3. Plk3 first was identified and cloned as an immediate early gene. Here, we report Plk3 localizes to the nucleolus and is involved in regulation of the G1/S phase transition. We demonstrate that the level of Plk3 protein is cell cycle regulated, peaking in G1. We have delivered Plk3-interfering RNA with lentivirus to serum-starved cells and found that, upon serum stimulation, Plk3 is required for cyclin E expression and entry into S phase. Plk3-interfering RNA-induced Plk3 depletion resulted in a large fraction of asynchronously proliferating cells to become quiescent. We propose the Plk3 requirement in the cell cycle is fulfilled in G1, and that once cells pass this point, they are able to complete cell division, whereas in the absence of Plk3, they fail to reenter the cell cycle. Additional data suggest that Plk3 may regulate entry into S phase in part through interaction with the phosphatase Cdc25A, because its depletion also resulted in attenuation of cyclin E expression.},

	volume = {8},
	issn = {0890-9369},
	abstract = {The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene CHOP (GADD153) encodes a small nuclear protein from the C/EBP family, originally isolated from adipocytes in culture. Although inactive in cells under normal conditions, the CHOP gene is markedly induced by a variety of cellular stresses, including nutrient deprivation and metabolic perturbations. These lead to accumulation of CHOP protein in the nucleus. Because cellular stress normally leads to growth arrest, we examined the implication of CHOP in this process. Microinjection of CHOP expression plasmids into NIH-3T3 cells blocked the cells from progressing through the cell cycle, measured by an attenuation in the fraction of cells incorporating BrdU, an S-phase marker. The precise point in the cell cycle at which CHOP acts was mapped by microinjection of bacterially expressed CHOP protein into synchronized cells--this blocked the cells from progressing from G1 to S phase. This effect of CHOP was observed only when the protein was introduced early after serum stimulation suggesting that CHOP works at or around the so-called G1/S checkpoint. CHOP dimerizes with other C/EBP proteins and the CHOP-C/EBP dimers are directed away from "classical" C/EBP sites recognizing instead unique "nonclassical" sites. Mutant forms of the CHOP protein that lack the leucine zipper dimerization domain or the unusually structured basic region, potentially involved in DNA binding, fail to induce growth arrest. A tumor-specific form of CHOP, TLS-CHOP, that has been found so far exclusively in the human adipose tissue tumor myxoid liposarcoma, fails to cause growth arrest and furthermore interferes with the ability of normal CHOP to induce growth arrest. CHOP has been shown recently to be markedly inducible by nutritional deprivation of cells. This suggests that CHOP may play a role in an inducible growth arrest pathway that is triggered by metabolic cues and is of particular importance in adipose tissue--an organ that undergoes marked changes in its metabolic activity. Blocking of this pathway by TLS-CHOP may play a mechanistic role in the establishment of myxoid liposarcoma.},

We investigated the initial steps of NO-mediated apoptosis in mouse macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells. When cells were treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ), NO-mediated apoptosis occurred. Under these conditions, p53 accumulation was not observed, indicating that DNA damage is not the main trigger of NO-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, mRNA and protein for CHOP, a transcription factor known to be induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, were induced. The CHOP induction by LPS/IFN-γ treatment preceded cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In addition, p90ATF6, an ER membrane-bound transcription factor involved in ER stress response, was cleaved to its active soluble form p50ATF6, which was transported to nucleus and bound to the ER stress response element of the CHOP gene. In the luciferase reporter assay, both the CHOP-binding element of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and ER stress response element of theCHOP gene were activated by LPS/IFN-γ treatment. When RAW 264.7 cells or COS-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for CHOP, p90ATF6, or p50ATF6, cell death was observed. In addition, apoptosis induced by p50ATF6 was prevented by a CHOP dominant negative form as well as by an ATF6 dominant negative form, and LPS/IFN-γ-induced apoptosis was prevented by the CHOP dominant negative form. Peritoneal macrophages from CHOP knockout mice showed resistance to NO-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the ER stress pathway involving ATF6 and CHOP plays a key role in NO-mediated apoptosis in macrophages.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Metastatic disease is a leading cause of death for patients with breast cancer, driving the need for new therapies. CT20p is a peptide previously discovered by our group that displays cancer-specific cytotoxicity. To design the optimal therapeutic use of the peptide, we identified the intracellular target of CT20p in breast cancer cells, correlating expression patterns of the target with susceptibility to CT20p.

Experimental Design
Using polymeric nanoparticles to deliver CT20p, we assessed cytoskeletal changes, cell migration, adhesion, and viability in cells treated with the peptide. Protein pull-down experiments, coupled to mass spectrometry, enabled identification of the peptide’s intracellular target. Biochemical and histological techniques validated target identity in human cell lines and breast cancer tissue microarrays and revealed susceptibility patterns to CT20p.

Results
Chaperonin Containing TCP-1 (CCT) was identified as the intracellular target of CT20p. Cancer cells susceptible to CT20p had increased CCT, and overexpression of CCTβ, a subunit of the CCT complex, enhanced susceptibility to CT20p. Susceptible cells displayed reduced tubulin, a substrate of CCT, and inhibition of migration upon CT20p treatment. CCTβ levels were higher in invasive ductal carcinomas than in cancer adjacent tissues and increased with breast cancer stage. Decreased breast cancer patient survival correlated with genomic alternations in CCTβ and higher levels of the chaperone.

Conclusion
Increased CCT protein in breast cancer cells underlies the cytotoxicity of CT20p. CCT is thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention and serves as a companion diagnostic to personalize the therapeutic use of CT20p for breast cancer treatment.},

The morphology of cells undergoing apoptosis is similar to cells undergoing both normal mitosis and an aberrant form of mitosis called mitotic catastrophe. During each of these processes, cells release substrate attachments, lose cell volume, condense their chromatin, and disassemble the nuclear lamina. The morphological similarities among cells undergoing these processes suggest that the underlying biochemical changes also may be related. The susceptibility of cells to apoptosis frequently depends on the differentiation state of the cell. Additionally, cell cycle checkpoints appear to link the cell cycle to apoptosis. Deregulation of the cell cycle components has been shown to induce mitotic catastrophe and also may be involved in triggering apoptosis. Some apoptotic cells express abnormal levels of cell cycle proteins and often contain active Cdc2, the primary kinase active during mitosis. Although cell cycle components may not be involved in all forms of apoptosis, in many instances cell proliferation and cell death may share common pathways.},

	abstract = {In multicellular organisms, cell proliferation and death must be regulated to maintain tissue homeostasis. Many observations suggest that this regulation may be achieved, in part, by coupling the process of cell cycle progression and programmed cell death by using and controlling a shared set of factors. An argument in favor of a link between the cell cycle and apoptosis arises from the accumulated evidence that manipulation of the cell cycle may either prevent or induce an apoptotic response. This linkage has been recognized for tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and RB, the dominant oncogene, c-Myc, several cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their regulators. These proteins that function in proliferative pathways may also act to sensitize cells to apoptosis. Indeed, unregulated cell proliferation can result in pathologic conditions including neoplasias if it is not countered by the appropriate cell death. Translating the knowledge gained by studying the connection between cell death and cell proliferation may aid in identifying novel therapies to circumvent disease progression or improve clinical outcome.},

	abstract = {Numerous pathological amyloid proteins spread from cell to cell during neurodegenerative disease, facilitating the propagation of cellular pathology and disease progression. Understanding the mechanism by which disease-associated amyloid protein assemblies enter target cells and induce cellular dysfunction is, therefore, key to understanding the progressive nature of such neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we utilized an imaging-based assay to monitor the ability of disease-associated amyloid assemblies to rupture intracellular vesicles following endocytosis. We observe that the ability to induce vesicle rupture is a common feature of α-synuclein (α-syn) assemblies, as assemblies derived from WT or familial disease-associated mutant α-syn all exhibited the ability to induce vesicle rupture. Similarly, different conformational strains of WT α-syn assemblies, but not monomeric or oligomeric forms, efficiently induced vesicle rupture following endocytosis. The ability to induce vesicle rupture was not specific to α-syn, as amyloid assemblies of tau and huntingtin Exon1 with pathologic polyglutamine repeats also exhibited the ability to induce vesicle rupture. We also observe that vesicles ruptured by α-syn are positive for the autophagic marker LC3 and can accumulate and fuse into large, intracellular structures resembling Lewy bodies in vitro. Finally, we show that the same markers of vesicle rupture surround Lewy bodies in brain sections from PD patients. These data underscore the importance of this conserved endocytic vesicle rupture event as a damaging mechanism of cellular invasion by amyloid assemblies of multiple neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins, and suggest that proteinaceous inclusions such as Lewy bodies form as a consequence of continued fusion of autophagic vesicles in cells unable to degrade ruptured vesicles and their amyloid contents.},

	abstract = {The increasing number of genome-wide assays of gene expression available from public databases presents opportunities for computational methods that facilitate hypothesis generation and biological interpretation of these data. We present an unsupervised machine learning approach, ADAGE (analysis using denoising autoencoders of gene expression), and apply it to the publicly available gene expression data compendium for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this approach, the machine-learned ADAGE model contained 50 nodes which we predicted would correspond to gene expression patterns across the gene expression compendium. While no biological knowledge was used during model construction, cooperonic genes had similar weights across nodes, and genes with similar weights across nodes were significantly more likely to share KEGG pathways. By analyzing newly generated and previously published microarray and transcriptome sequencing data, the ADAGE model identified differences between strains, modeled the cellular response to low oxygen, and predicted the involvement of biological processes based on low-level gene expression differences. ADAGE compared favorably with traditional principal component analysis and independent component analysis approaches in its ability to extract validated patterns, and based on our analyses, we propose that these approaches differ in the types of patterns they preferentially identify. We provide the ADAGE model with analysis of all publicly available P. aeruginosa GeneChip experiments and open source code for use with other species and settings. Extraction of consistent patterns across large-scale collections of genomic data using methods like ADAGE provides the opportunity to identify general principles and biologically important patterns in microbial biology. This approach will be particularly useful in less-well-studied microbial species.
IMPORTANCE The quantity and breadth of genome-scale data sets that examine RNA expression in diverse bacterial and eukaryotic species are increasing more rapidly than for curated knowledge. Our ADAGE method integrates such data without requiring gene function, gene pathway, or experiment labeling, making practical its application to any large gene expression compendium. We built a Pseudomonas aeruginosa ADAGE model from a diverse set of publicly available experiments without any prespecified biological knowledge, and this model was accurate and predictive. We provide ADAGE results for the complete P. aeruginosa GeneChip compendium for use by researchers studying P. aeruginosa and source code that facilitates ADAGE’s application to other species and data types.

	abstract = {Degradation of mRNA is one of the key processes that control the steady-state level of gene expression. However, the rate of mRNA decay for the majority of genes is not known. We successfully obtained the rate of mRNA decay for 19 977 non-redundant genes by microarray analysis of RNA samples obtained from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Median estimated half-life was 7.1 h and only {\textless}100 genes, including Prdm1, Myc, Gadd45 g, Foxa2, Hes5 and Trib1, showed half-life less than 1 h. In general, mRNA species with short half-life were enriched among genes with regulatory functions (transcription factors), whereas mRNA species with long half-life were enriched among genes related to metabolism and structure (extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton). The stability of mRNAs correlated more significantly with the structural features of genes than the function of genes: mRNA stability showed the most significant positive correlation with the number of exon junctions per open reading frame length, and negative correlation with the presence of PUF-binding motifs and AU-rich elements in 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and CpG di-nucleotides in the 5′-UTR. The mRNA decay rates presented in this report are the largest data set for mammals and the first for ES cells.},

	abstract = {Since it became clear that intervening sequences or introns are spliced out from precursor pre-mRNA molecules in the nucleus before mature mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm, questions were raised about the timing of splicing. Does splicing start while RNA polymerase II is still transcribing? Is splicing a slow or a fast process? Is timing important to control the splicing reaction? Although our understanding on the mechanism and function of splicing is largely based on data obtained using biochemical and large-scale “omic” approaches, microscopy has been instrumental to address questions related to timing. Experiments done with the electron microscope paved the way to the discovery of splicing and provided unequivocal evidence that splicing can occur co-transcriptionally. More recently, live-cell microscopy introduced a technical breakthrough that allows real-time visualization of splicing dynamics. We discuss here some of the microscopy advances that provided the basis for the current conceptual view of the splicing process and we outline a most recent development that permits direct measurement, in living cells, of the time it takes to synthesize and excise an intron from individual pre-mRNA molecules.},

Hybridization was facilitated by freezing and thawing of the solutions, and the denaturation of these hybrid materials showed transition temperatures over a narrow range that allowed differentiation of a variety of imperfect targets. Transfer of the hybridization mixture to a reverse-phase silica plate resulted in a blue color upon drying that could be detected visually.

Quality assurance efforts have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the growing repository of these models.

	abstract = {Mussel foot protein (mfp), a natural glue produced by marine mussel, is an intriguing material because of its superior ability for adhesion in various environments. For example, a very small amount of this material is sufficient to affix a mussel to a substrate in water, providing structural support under extreme forces caused by the dynamic effects of waves. Towards a more complete understanding of its strength and underwater workability, it is necessary to understand the microscropic mechanisms by which the protein structure interacts with various substrates. However, none of the mussel proteins’ structure is known, preventing us from directly using atomistic modeling to probe their structural and mechanical properties. Here we use an advanced molecular sampling technique to identify the molecular structures of two mussel foot proteins (mfp-3 and mfp-5) and use those structures to study their mechanics of adhesion, which is then incorporated into a continuum model. We calculate the adhesion energy of the mussel foot protein on a silica substrate, compute the adhesion strength based on results obtained from molecular modeling, and compare with experimental data. Our results show good agreement with experimental measurements, which validates the multiscale model. We find that the molecular structure of the folded mussel foot protein (ultimately defined by its genetic sequence) favors strong adhesion to substrates, where L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (or DOPA) protein subunits work in a cooperative manner to enhance adhesion. Our experimental data suggests a peak attachment force of 0.4±0.1N, which compares favorably with the prediction from the multiscale model of Fc=0.21–0.33N. The principles learnt from those results could guide the fabrication of new interfacial materials (e.g. composites) to integrate organic with inorganic surfaces in an effective manner.},

Through enhanced sampling molecular dynamics, here we demonstrate that proteins with DOPA residues have a strong affinity to a silica surface with an interfacial strength of several hundreds of thousand N/cm2. The mechanism of such strong adhesion is a pair of hydrogen bonds that forms between DOPA and the substrate, enabling enhanced cooperativity as the DOPA residue lays flat on top the surface. Our predicted adhesion force (743 pN) agrees well with experimental measurements (847 ± 157 pN), including the orientation of the DOPA residue on the surface.},

	abstract = {Marine mussels strongly adhere to various surfaces and endure their attachment under a variety of conditions. In order to understand the basic mechanism involved, we study the adsorption of L-dopa molecule on hydrophilic geminal and terminal isolated silanols of silica (001) surface. High content of modified amino acid L-dopa is found in the glue-like material secreted by the mussels through which it sticks to various surfaces under water. To understand the adsorption behavior, we have made use of periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) study. The L-dopa molecule adheres to silica surfaces terminated with geminal and terminal silanols via its catechol part. In both cases, the adhesion is achieved through the formation of 4 H-bonds. A binding energy of 29.48 and 31.67 kcal/mol has been estimated, after the inclusion of dispersion energy, for geminal and terminal silanols of silica, respectively. These results suggest a relatively stronger adhesion of dopa molecule for surface with terminal isolated silanols.},

Given the dearth of synthetic adhesives for wet polar surfaces, much effort has been directed to characterizing and mimicking essential features of the adhesive chemistry practiced by mussels. Studies of these organisms have uncovered important adaptive strategies that help to circumvent the high dielectric and solvation properties of water that typically frustrate adhesion. In a chemical vein, the adhesive proteins of mussels are heavily decorated with Dopa, a catecholic functionality. Various synthetic polymers have been functionalized with catechols to provide diverse adhesive, sealant, coating, and anchoring properties, particularly for critical biomedical applications.},

Most studies of these interactions to date have relied on bulk methods, which in many systems cannot capture the dynamic single-cell nature of these interactions as they modulate cell states. One method allowing for sensitive single-cell mapping of protein-DNA interactions is DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID), which records a protein’s DNA-binding history by methylating adenine bases in its vicinity, then selectively amplifies and sequences these methylated regions. These interaction sites can also be visualized using fluorescent proteins that bind to methyladenines. Here we combine these imaging and sequencing technologies in an integrated microfluidic platform (μDamID) that enables single-cell isolation, imaging, and sorting, followed by DamID. We apply this system to generate paired single-cell imaging and sequencing data from a human cell line, in which we map and validate interactions between DNA and nuclear lamina proteins, providing a measure of 3D chromatin organization and broad gene regulation patterns. μDamID provides the unique ability to compare paired imaging and sequencing data for each cell and between cells, enabling the joint analysis of the nuclear localization, sequence identity, and variability of protein-DNA interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent evidence suggests that compartments are smaller than previously thought and that the transcriptional or chromatin state is responsible for interactions leading to the formation of small compartmental domains in all organisms. In vertebrates, CTCF forms loop domains, probably via an extrusion process involving cohesin. CTCF loops cooperate with compartmental domains to establish the 3D organization of the genome. The continuous extrusion of the chromatin fibre by cohesin may also be responsible for the establishment of enhancer-promoter interactions and stochastic aspects of the transcription process. These observations suggest that the 3D organization of the genome is an emergent property of chromatin and its components, and thus may not be only a determinant but also a consequence of its function.},

Here, we develop a method for controlling gene expression based on Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease from a type II CRISPR system. We show that a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide RNA, generates a DNA recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, RNA polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells. This RNA-guided DNA recognition platform provides a simple approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale.},

Either direct interaction between proteins or proximity enabled DAM reconstitution and methylation of adenine in GATC. Inducible SpDamID was used to analyze Notch-mediated transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that Notch complexes label RBP sites broadly across the genome and show that a subset of these complexes that recruit MAML and p300 undergo changes in chromatin accessibility in response to Notch signaling. SpDamID differentiates between monomeric and dimeric binding, thereby allowing for identification of half-site motifs used by Notch dimers. Motif enrichment of Notch enhancers coupled with SpDamID reveals co-targeting of regulatory sequences by Notch and Runx1.

The dynamics of these interactions and the relation to epigenetic modifications are poorly understood. We visualized the fate of LADs in single cells using a “molecular contact memory” approach. In each nucleus, only ∼30\% of LADs are positioned at the periphery; these LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the NL but remain constrained to the periphery. Upon mitosis, LAD positioning is not detectably inherited but instead is stochastically reshuffled. Contact of individual LADs with the NL is linked to transcriptional repression and H3K9 dimethylation in single cells. Furthermore, we identify the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a as a regulator of NL contacts. Collectively, these results highlight principles of the dynamic spatial architecture of chromosomes in relation to gene regulation.},

Using this method, we have studied telomere dynamics during elongation or disruption, the subnuclear localization of the MUC4 loci, the cohesion of replicated MUC4 loci on sister chromatids, and their dynamic behaviors during mitosis.

	abstract = {Sequence-specific control of gene expression on a genome-wide scale is an important approach for understanding gene functions and for engineering genetic regulatory systems. We have recently described an RNA-based method, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), for targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells. The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the repression of the target gene. Here we provide a protocol for the design, construction and expression of customized sgRNAs for transcriptional repression of any gene of interest. We also provide details for testing the repression activity of CRISPRi using quantitative fluorescence assays and native elongating transcript sequencing. CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within 1–2 weeks. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary approach to RNA interference, which can be used in a wider variety of organisms.},

By tethering Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) to a chromatin protein, Dam can be targeted in vivo to native binding sites of this protein, resulting in local DNA methylation. Sites of methylation can subsequently be mapped using methylation-specific restriction enzymes or antibodies. We demonstrate the successful application of DamID both in Drosophila cell cultures and in whole flies. When Dam is tethered to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, targeted methylation is limited to a region of a few kilobases surrounding a GAL4 binding sequence. Using DamID, we identified a number of expected and unexpected target loci for Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1. DamID has potential for genome-wide mapping of in vivo targets of chromatin proteins in various eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the investigation of complex biological processes in multicellular organisms with high resolution. However, many phenotypic features that are critical to understanding the functional role of cells in a heterogeneous tissue or organ are not directly encoded in the genome and therefore cannot be profiled with scRNA-seq. Quantitative optical microscopy has long been a powerful approach for characterizing diverse cellular phenotypes including cell morphology, protein localization, and chemical composition. Combining scRNA-seq with optical imaging has the potential to provide comprehensive single-cell analysis, allowing for functional integration of gene expression profiling and cell-state characterization. However, it is difficult to track single cells through both measurements; therefore, coupling current scRNA-seq protocols with optical measurements remains a challenge. Here, we report Microfluidic Cell Barcoding and Sequencing (μCB-seq), a microfluidic platform that combines high-resolution imaging and sequencing of single cells. μCB-seq is enabled by a novel fabrication method that preloads primers with known barcode sequences inside addressable reaction chambers of a microfluidic device. In addition to enabling multi-modal single-cell analysis, μCB-seq improves gene detection sensitivity, providing a scalable and accurate method for information-rich characterization of single cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Photodamage to the myelin sheath in spinal tissues is induced by using the point scan mode and is featured by myelin splitting and shockwaves with broadband emission. Our measurement of photodamage rate versus the excitation power reveals that both linear and nonlinear mechanisms are involved. Moreover, we show that vibrational absorption induced by coherent Raman processes significantly contributes to the nonlinear damage at high peak powers. For CARS imaging of cultured cells, the photodamage is characterized by plasma membrane blebbing and is dominated by a second order mechanism. Our study suggests that for dense samples such as the myelin sheath, CARS imaging induced photodamage can be minimized by using laser beams with relatively long near IR wavelengths and a repetition rate of a few MHz. For less dense samples such as cultured cells, laser pulses of higher repetition rates are preferred.},

When addressing endogenous signals such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) or second harmonic generation, it requires intense laser irradiation that may cause photodamage. We report that increasing endogenous fluorescence signal upon multiphoton imaging constitutes a marker of photodamage. The effect was studied on mouse brain in vivo and ex vivo, on ex vivo human brain tissue samples, as well as on glioblastoma cells in vitro, demonstrating that this phenomenon is common to a variety of different systems, both ex vivo and in vivo. CARS microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy were used to analyze the photodamage. The development of a standard easy-to-use model that employs rehydrated cryosections allowed the characterization of the irradiation-induced fluorescence and related it to nonlinear photodamage. In conclusion, the monitoring of endogenous two-photon excited fluorescence during label-free multiphoton microscopy enables to estimate damage thresholds ex vivo as well as detect photodamage during in vivo experiments.},

Although the use of LPT has advantages, the molecular mechanisms involved in the process of accelerated healing and the safety concerns associated with LPT are still poorly understood. We investigated the physiological effects of LPT irradiation on the production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), genomic instability, and deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) damage in human epithelial cells. In contrast to a high energy density (20 J/cm2), laser administered at a low energy density (4 J/cm2) resulted in the accumulation of ROS. Interestingly, 4 J/cm2 of LPT did not induce DNA damage, genomic instability, or nuclear influx of the BRCA1 DNA damage repair protein, a known genome protective molecule that actively participates in DNA repair. Our results suggest that administration of low energy densities of LPT induces the accumulation of safe levels of ROS, which may explain the accelerated healing results observed in patients. These findings indicate that epithelial cells have an endowed molecular circuitry that responds to LPT by physiologically inducing accumulation of ROS, which triggers accelerated healing. Importantly, our results suggest that low energy densities of LPT can serve as a safe therapy to accelerate epithelial healing.},

	abstract = {Two-photon excitation-based near-infrared (NIR) laser scanning microscopy is currently emerging as a new and versatile alternative to conventional confocal laser scanning microscopy, particularly for vital cell imaging in life sciences. Although this innovative microscopy has several advantages such as highly localized excitation, higher penetration depth, reduced photobleaching and photodamage, and improved signal to noise ratio, it has, however, recently been evidenced that high-power NIR laser irradiation can drastically inhibit cell division and induce cell death. In the present study we have investigated the cellular responses of unlabeled rat kangaroo kidney epithelium (PtK2) cells to NIR femtosecond laser irradiation. We demonstrate that NIR 170-fs laser pulses operating at 80-MHz pulse repetition frequency and at mean power of {\textgreater} or = 7 mW evoke generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 that can be visualized in situ by standard in vivo cytochemical analysis using Ni-3,3'-diaminobenzidine (Ni-DAB) as well as with a recently developed fluorescent probe Jenchrom px blue. The formation of the Ni-DAB reaction product as well as that of Jenchrom was relatively more pronounced when irradiated cells were incubated in alkaline solution (pH 8) than in those incubated in acidic solution (pH 6), suggesting peroxisomal localization of these reaction products. Two-photon time-lapse imaging of the internalization of the cell impermeate fluorescent dye propidium iodide revealed that the integrity of the plasma membrane of NIR irradiated cells is drastically compromised. Visualization of the nuclei with DNA-specific fluorescent probes such as 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 24 h postirradiation further provided tangible evidence that the nuclei of these cells undergo several deformations and eventual fragmentation. That these NIR irradiated cells die by apoptosis has been established by in situ detection of DNA strand breaks using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling method. Because the reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 and OH* can cause noxious effects such as cell membrane injury by peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids and proteins and oxidative phosphorylation, and alterations of ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps, these ROS are likely to contribute to drastic cytological alterations observed in this study following NIR irradiation. Taken together, we have established that NIR laser irradiations at mean power {\textgreater} or = 7 mW delivered at pulse duration time of 170 fs generally used in two- and multiphoton microscopes cause oxidative stress (1) evoking production of ROS, (2) resulting in membrane barrier dysfunction, (3) inducing structural deformations and fragmentation of the nuclei as well as DNA strand breaks, (4) leading to cell death by apoptosis.},
